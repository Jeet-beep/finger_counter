# Hand Detection using MediaPipe

This Python script detects and counts raised fingers in a live webcam feed using the MediaPipe library. It utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze hand landmarks and determine the number of fingers raised.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.6 or higher)
- OpenCV (`opencv-python` package)
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe` package)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the `hand_detection.py` file:

```bash
cd your-repository
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python hand_detection.py
```

4. Point your webcam towards your hand and raise fingers to see the finger count displayed on the screen.

## Features

- Detects hand landmarks in real-time.
- Counts the number of raised fingers.
- Draws hand landmarks and finger count on the webcam feed.

## Acknowledgements

- [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) for providing the hand detection model.
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for image processing capabilities.
